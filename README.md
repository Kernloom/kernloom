# Kernloom

[![CI](https://github.com/Kernloom/kernloom/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Kernloom/kernloom/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Kernloom is a modular, open Zero Trust and anomaly detection platform for Linux workloads. The local runtime consists of two tightly integrated components:

- **`klshield`** — XDP/eBPF data plane. Enforces deny/rate-limit decisions in the kernel packet path at line rate.
- **`kliq`** — userspace intelligence agent. Learns traffic baselines and communication graphs, evaluates enterprise policy via a contracts-based Runtime PDP, brokers TTL-bounded enforcement actions, and integrates with Forge for managed-mode operation.

## Two use cases

### Scenario A — DoS Prevention (public-facing nodes)

**When:** Internet-facing nodes — Ziti controller, Ziti router, public web server, reverse proxy.

**What:** KLIQ learns the active adapter's normal source-level metrics and rate-limits or blocks sources that deviate. With KLShield this means PPS/SYN/scan/BPS rates; with another adapter it can be dial rate, auth failures, posture failures, API error rate, or any other adapter-published metric/signal. No graph learning, no SQLite, minimal overhead.

### Scenario B — Microsegmentation (internal nodes)

**When:** Internal nodes communicating with a small, known set of services — database, IdP, internal API, NAS.

**What:** KLIQ learns the communication graph as generic subject-predicate-object relationships. After freeze, unexpected relationships are detected and RuntimePDP can decide whether to restrict them. The concrete enforcement target depends on the adapter: KLShield can enforce network tuples such as `(src_ip, port, proto)` in XDP; an OpenZiti adapter would enforce Ziti identities/services only once it exposes the corresponding RelationshipPEP.

---

## Runtime profiles

| Profile | Active subsystems |
|---|---|
| `dos-light` | Source heuristics + adapter-scoped autotune. No graph, no SQLite. |
| `iq-learning` | dos-light + per-source EWMA baseline + state store. |
| `graph-learning` | iq-learning + relationship telemetry + graph learning + relationship/edge baselines + SQLite. |
| `graph-enforce` | graph-learning + relationship tuple enforcement when a configured adapter exposes a RelationshipPEP. KLShield implements this with XDP tuple maps. |

Profiles enable KLIQ subsystems; adapters provide the concrete observations and PEP capabilities. `dos-light` is not intrinsically PPS/SYN/scan-only: those are KLShield/network metrics. `graph-enforce` is not intrinsically XDP-only: XDP is the current KLShield backend for network tuples, while other adapters can use the same graph/RuntimePDP path once they publish relationships and implement matching enforcement capabilities.

---

## Quick start — DoS Prevention

```bash
sudo ./bin/klshield attach-xdp --iface eth0 \
  --obj shield/bpf/out/xdp_kernloom_shield.bpf.o
sudo ./bin/kliq run \
  --adapter=klshield \
  --feature-profile=dos-light \
  --pdp-config=configs/pdp/ziti-controller-bootstrap.yaml \
  --runtime-pdp-mode=shadow \
  --dry-run=true \
  --whitelist-learn=true
./bin/kliq status
```

See `configs/pdp/` for all PDPConfig profiles.

```bash
# Phase 1 — learn (14 days dry-run)

```

## Managed mode (with Forge)

When a Forge control plane is available, KLIQ operates in managed mode:

```bash
# Pre-register the node and copy the printed enroll_token.
forge enroll-token create \
  --store /etc/kernloom/forge-enroll-tokens.yaml \
  --node-id <node-id>

# Start the Forge API server (in kernloom-forge repo).
forge serve \
  --addr :8443 \
  --enroll-token-store /etc/kernloom/forge-enroll-tokens.yaml

# Connect KLIQ to Forge
./bin/kliq run \
  --mode=managed \
  --graph-node-id=<node-id> \
  --forge-url=https://forge.example.com:8443 \
  --forge-enroll-token=<printed-enroll-token> \
  --policy-verify-key=/etc/kernloom/forge.pub \
  --runtime-pdp-mode=shadow   # or: active
```

**`--runtime-pdp-mode`:**
- `shadow` (default) — RuntimePDP evaluates and logs decisions only. Analyzers, graph and FSM can still produce facts/intent, but no enforcement action is emitted.
- `active` — RuntimePDP is the policy authority. Adapter analyzers, graph, baselines, identity, and FSM/hysteresis components provide facts/intent; only RuntimePDP decisions become enforcement actions via the action broker.

RuntimePDP policy rules can use generic fact maps such as `risk`, `metrics`, `signals`, `baseline`, `graph`, `adapter`, `fsm`, `device`, `session`, and `features`. `risk` is produced through the local risk aggregator; `baseline` can include learned metric profiles from SQLite as well as active thresholds; `graph` can include learned relationships for the subject. For example, a network rule can compare `metrics.network.packets_per_second` with `baseline.network.packets_per_second` without making KLShield the decision owner.

When an adapter reports canonical enforcement feedback, KLIQ treats it as evidence that an active mitigation is still doing work. RuntimePolicyPacks can include a hold rule before broad high-risk rules, for example `fsm.current_level in ['soft', 'hard', 'block'] && signals.enforcement.active` with a renewed `enforce.traffic.rate_limit` TTL. This prevents post-mitigation telemetry from looking falsely clean while packets, denies, or equivalent PEP feedback are still being produced.

RuntimePDP exposes enforcement feedback under `signals.enforcement.*`:

| Fact | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `signals.enforcement.feedback_rate` | Generic feedback rate across enforcement-side evidence |
| `signals.enforcement.drop_rate` | Drop rate; for KLShield this is `network.rate_limit_drop_rate` |
| `signals.enforcement.deny_rate` | Deny/reject rate; currently `0` until an adapter reports it |
| `signals.enforcement.throttle_rate` | Throttle/backpressure rate; currently `0` until an adapter reports it |
| `signals.enforcement.active` | `true` when any enforcement feedback rate is greater than zero |

`signals.enforcement_feedback_rate` remains as a backward-compatible alias for `signals.enforcement.feedback_rate`.

The current risk model is implemented in code: adapter/analyzer signals are aggregated into a `LocalRiskAssessment` with score, level, confidence, domains and contributions. A separately signed/declarative `RuntimeRiskModel` artifact is not implemented yet; that remains a follow-up to make risk semantics fully policy-managed.

In managed mode KLIQ:
1. Enrolls the node and heartbeats runtime status to Forge
2. Downloads a signed `RuntimeBundle` from Forge
3. Verifies Ed25519 signature, generation monotonicity, and expiry
4. Applies bootstrap autotune, graph lifecycle and enforcement bounds
5. Loads local or Forge-delivered `LocalPolicyPack` or `RuntimePolicyPack` files through the same policy gate
6. Persists enforcement leases/receipts locally and uploads pending receipts to Forge

Standalone nodes can also load a contracts-based RuntimePolicyPack directly:

```bash
./bin/kliq run \
  --adapter=klshield \
  --policy-file=/etc/kernloom/policies/runtime-policy.yaml \
  --runtime-pdp-mode=shadow \
  --dry-run=true
```

`--policy-file` accepts:
- `kind: LocalPolicyPack` — local KLIQ policy and threshold tuning.
- `kind: RuntimePolicyPack` with `apiVersion: kernloom.io/runtime/v1alpha1` — contracts-based Runtime PDP rules. In `shadow` mode decisions are logged; in `active` mode matched Runtime PDP decisions are mapped to `ActionProposal`s and enforced through the action broker.

---

## Forge compatibility contract

Shared Runtime PDP wire schemas are imported from `github.com/kernloom/kernloom-contracts` (v0.1.0). During the migration, managed bundle ingestion still uses the local `pkg/core/bundle` model.

```
RuntimeBundle          kernloom.io/runtime/v1alpha1
RuntimePolicyPack      kernloom.io/runtime/v1alpha1
LocalRiskAssessment    kernloom.io/runtime/v1alpha1
RuntimeDecision        kernloom.io/runtime/v1alpha1
EnforcementReceipt     kernloom.io/runtime/v1alpha1
RuntimeFinding         kernloom.io/runtime/v1alpha1
BundleAck              kernloom.io/runtime/v1alpha1
```

KLIQ keeps conformance fixtures for signed runtime bundles, unsupported schema/capability/action/mode combinations, and offline last-known-good (`fail_static`) validation in `iq/internal/conformance/`.

---

## Runtime state and baselines

KLIQ keeps two different kinds of learned runtime data:

- **Metric baselines** live in SQLite and describe normal behaviour for a subject or relationship, such as an `iq-learning` source's learned `network.packets_per_second` or a graph edge's learned packet rate.
- **Autotune thresholds** live in `state.json` and describe adapter-specific detector thresholds. These are scoped under `active.tuning_scopes`, for example `klshield:network`, so KLShield/XDP PPS/SYN/scan thresholds are not applied to an OpenZiti-only node.

Legacy `active.trig` fields remain readable when loading old state files, but new state writes omit that top-level mirror and persist metric IDs only under the matching tuning scope.

Baselines can be inspected and reset from the CLI:

```bash
./bin/kliq baselines list --db=/tmp/kernloom-manual/kliq-state.db --scope=source --sort=-obs
./bin/kliq baselines list --db=/tmp/kernloom-manual/kliq-state.db --scope=relationship --sort=-obs
./bin/kliq baselines delete --db=/tmp/kernloom-manual/kliq-state.db --scope=relationship --source-class=xdp --metric=network.xdp.edge --dry-run
./bin/kliq baselines delete --db=/tmp/kernloom-manual/kliq-state.db --scope=relationship --source-class=xdp --metric=network.xdp.edge
```

Baseline tables support `--sort=metric|subject|source|scope|truth|window|state|baseline|peak|confidence|obs|updated`; prefix the key with `-` for descending order.

Unfiltered baseline deletion is rejected unless `--all` is set explicitly.

---

## Action leases and receipts

Every TTL-bounded enforcement action is recorded as an `ActionLease` before the PEP is called. Leases carry:
- a fencing token (prevents blind revert if the target was manually changed or a newer lease took over)
- expiry time and previous state reference
- revert status: `pending` → `reverted` | `conflict` | `failed`

Receipts are emitted for every apply/revert and persisted in SQLite (`action_receipts` table). A background goroutine uploads pending receipts to Forge every 30 seconds.
KLIQ also reverts expired source and relationship leases from the main runtime tick, so tuple/relationship actions have the same expiry and receipt path as source actions.

---

## OpenZiti adapter

The OpenZiti adapter currently lives in `pkg/adapters/openziti/`:

| Package | Status | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `eventsource/` | ✅ implemented | `EventSource` interface, `RawVendorEvent`, version discovery, file replay |
| `decoder/` | ✅ implemented | Tolerant decoder for P0 namespaces (authentication, apiSession, session, usage, sdk) |
| `mapping/` | ✅ implemented | VendorFact → canonical Observation (no vendor field names in output) |
| `relationshiplearner/` | ✅ implemented | `ziti.dials` identity → service relationships from canonical observations |
| `signalengine/` | planned | OpenZiti-specific signal engine |
| `learningguard/` | planned | adapterruntime.LearningGuard |
| `actions/` | planned | remove access attribute, disable identity and related OpenZiti PEP actions |

Key invariants:
- `decoder/` is the only package that references OpenZiti field names.
- `service.dial.fail` is NOT mapped to identity risk (spec §7.4 — aggregated metric, not identity-attributed).
- Unknown event namespaces produce `SemanticStatus=unknown_namespace`, never a silent wrong signal.

## Adapter boundary rule

`pkg/adapters/` is reserved for vendor/product integrations only. Generic pipeline components live in `pkg/pipeline/` or sibling packages.

A complete vendor adapter contains all product-specific code in one directory:
`eventsource`, `decoder`, `mapping`, `extractor`, `signalengine`, `learningguard`, `relationshiplearner`, `pep`, `actions`.

Core packages (`pkg/core/`, `pkg/pipeline/`, etc.) must never contain vendor names as Go identifiers.

## Known technical debt

See `TECHNICAL_DEBT.md` for the full prioritised list. Key items:

| Issue | Priority |
|---|---|
| Shared `kernloom-contracts` module is not yet fully adopted by managed bundle ingestion | P1 |
| Runtime fact/context registry for adapter-published metrics, graph predicates, and missing inputs is still needed | P1 |
| `iq/cmd/kliq` still owns too much runtime orchestration and should keep shrinking into internal services | P1 |
| Historical names such as `LocalPolicyPack` and `PDPConfig` remain visible during the migration | P2 |
